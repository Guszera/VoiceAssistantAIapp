This project is the development of an AI Virtual Assistant designed to improve road safety by 
allowing road users to interact and engage without using their hands. AI Virtual Assistants 
have shown significant potential in improving everyday activities through voice commands 
and natural language processing. This project focuses on road users, particularly but not 
limited to those engaged with delivery services, who face safety risks when interacting with 
mobile devices while driving. The illegality of handling mobile phones while driving requires
a solution that supports necessary functions such as navigation, call handling, and task 
management without having userâ€™s physical interaction with devices.
The project will use advanced technologies including machine learning and voice recognition 
to understand user commands and execute tasks efficiently, with the goal of reducing
distractions and enhance user safety. The language Java will be used for development, as it 
has shown to be simple and effective in previous successful Android applications. The virtual 
assistant will include features such as service initialisation controlled by the user, hands-free 
app interaction, and media control, ensuring that drivers can perform any action they choose
without compromising their safety on driving.


The idea for this project comes from the important intersection of AI technology and road 
safety, an area that presents both significant challenges and opportunities. Road safety is a top 
priority in our increasingly mobile environment, as drivers' attention is constantly diverted by 
numerous tasks that involve interaction with mobile devices. This project envisions a system 
designed to improve the safety of road users, particularly those whose jobs, such as delivery 
drivers, need constant interaction with technology while on the road.
At its core, this project aims to use AI capabilities to promote a safer driving environment via 
a hands-free AI Virtual Assistant. This assistant is intended to conduct operations reducing 
the requirement of using physical touch with equipment, therefore reducing distractions, and 
focusing on the core objective of driving. By utilising AI tools such as natural language 
processing and voice recognition, the project seeks to deliver a robust system that enhances 
user interaction while prioritising safety.
